NOTE

This current implementation requires images to be in XPM 3 format as outputted
from mogrify, and the image must have roughly only 90 different colors in it so
that each color is represented by exactly 1 character in the xpm file,
essentially the XPM must also be a true ascii art image.

If the image didn't turn out right, first thing to check is if the legend
inside the xpm file has multiple digits used in the lookup key.

USAGE EXAMPLE

# Make sure xpm2html is in PATH
chmod +x xpm2html

# Make sure ImageMagick (mogrify) is in PATH
# Place a file named image.png in the current directory
cp image.png small.png
mogrify -geometry x50 small.png  # in-place resize to height of 50
mogrify -format xpm small.png
cat small.xpm | xpm2html > small.html
# open small.html in the browser
